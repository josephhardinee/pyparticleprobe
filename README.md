pyparticleprobe
===============

A python package to process cloud and precipitation particle probe  data.

Author: Nick Guy (nick.guy@noaa.gov)

Created:  21 Jan 2014   
Updated:  14 May 2014 â€“ Restructured functions and pathways   
Updated:  15 Jul 2014 - Refactored to take class structure.  Heavily influenced by the PyDisdrometer package by Joseph Hardin.  
Updated:   4 Aug 2014 - Implemented a number of housekeeping changed by Joseph Hardin to allow the possible future merge
                        with the PyDisdrometer package.

## Installation
As of now, I have used these as a standalone package that was not installed as a package.
To access, I just added the path where the folder was unpacked to my 
PYTHONPATH environmental variable path (in my .bashrc file)

e.g. export PYTHONPATH=/Users/nickguy/programs/python/pythonlib:/Users/nickguy/programs/python/pythonlib/pyparticleprobe

There is a setup.py file provided, HOWEVER this may not work properly and I would suggest
 using the above method to access the package until the software becomes more mature.
 
## Usage
Initiate class by opening a file.  There are a number of optional arguments that help in processing the file.
As of now these attributes are tailored to files created after processing the CIP/PIP probes aboard the NOAA P-3 aircraft.

```python
import pyparticleprobe

dsd = pyparticleprobe.read_file(filename)
```

To add additional analyis information:
```python
dsd.get_bin_parameters() # Bin the data over diameters bin

dsd.get_ts_parameters() # Bin the data over each time step

dsd.get_model_parameters(modelName='gamma_ua98') # Get the model fit parameters, default uses gamma model as in Ulbrich and Atlas (1998)
```

## Requirements
This library borrow heavily from the [PyDisdrometer](https://github.com/josephhardinee/PyDisdrometer) package.
Therefore it uses the typical scientific python stack.  Development used the Anaconda distribution (1.9.1 & Python 2.7.7).

It also requires the [PyTMatrix Package](https://github.com/jleinonen/pytmatrix) for scattering calculations.

## Notes
This code is in beta format and was designed to work with data from the NOAA P-3 aircraft that has been processed (by the University of California, Santa Cruz).  It should be extendable to other probe data, but will need to have a new reader if file structure is different.

Future enhancements will hopefully include the ability to read other data files.  
Also, the plotting portion depends on a local library on my machine and therefore won't work.  This will eventually be changed to allow some plots to be produced.
